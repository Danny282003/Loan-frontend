        <p className='w-[800px] m-auto'>Hi, I’m Biggie, a passionate and goal-driven individual who enjoys learning, building, and solving real-world problems. I’m constantly improving my skills and exploring new challenges, especially in areas that help people and make life easier through technology.

        I love working on projects that allow me to be creative, think critically, and grow consistently. Whether it’s building tools, improving user experiences, or learning something new, I’m always excited for what comes next.

        Outside of work, I enjoy staying curious, connecting with people, and finding ways to make a positive impact. </p>
